# Rob Wyant's GitHub Index
## Welcome
Welcome! 

This repo was created to help guide you through my story. I've worked on some fantastic projects -- _including a crowd funding solution to pay college athletes, a murder mystery game, and of course, my own startup that has amassed 10 enterprise clients and reached 100,000 devices_. 

I hope you enjoy this journey; please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback. Thanks!

### Lessons Learned
Founding a company brings with it a lifetime of _lessons learned_. **I have created a [separate branch](https://github.com/rwyant/index/tree/master/Yapper) to go over the really important points.** This is a living, breathing, and constantly evolving representation of the roller-coaster that is cofounding an early-stage startup, so keep coming back to see all of the new resources added over time. 

## GENERAL ASSEMBLY	- New York, NY

### Swift Guild
#### Summary
I helped found a community of General Assembly alumni who have graduated from the Mobile Development course (_called the **Swift Guild**_). As a group, we are responsible for an iOS App that showcases student built projects and gives members of our community a platform to get real-world feedback & make agile iterations. 

You can download the app from [Swift Guild on App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swift-guild/id1033229400?mt=8) or you can pull the code from the [Swift Guild Repo](https://github.com/rwyant/SwiftGuild).

### Cereal The Game
#### Summary
For my final project in my Mobile Development course, I worked with a friend at [Surprise Industries](http://surpriseindustries.com) to create a delicious Murder Mystery Game inspired by a certain homophonic podcast. 

You can listen to a sample of [Ep. 1: The Truth](http://insideyapper.com/CerealSample/Sample1.mp3), you can download the [iOS Game from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cereal-the-game/id981244698?mt=8), or you can pull the code from our [Cereal The Game GitHub Branch](https://github.com/rwyant/index/tree/master/Cereal%20The%20Game). Enjoy!

##PLAY FOR - Washington, DC
#### Crowdfunding for College Athletes
Ed O'Bannon v NCAA found that Universities can set up a trust of $5k per player per year of eligibility. We are crowdfunding that trust. Any transfers to an individual player in excess of $5k will be distributed evenly to that player's teammates. #playfortomorrow
