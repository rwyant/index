## WELCOME
Welcome! 

This repo was created to help guide you through my story. I've worked on some fantastic projects -- _including a crowd funding solution to pay college athletes, a murder mystery game, and of course, my own startup that has amassed 10 enterprise clients and reached 100,000 devices_. 

I hope you enjoy this journey; please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback. Thanks!

### Lessons Learned
The founding of an early-stage tech startup brings with it a lifetime of _lessons learned_. **_I am working on creating a [separate branch](https://github.com/rwyant/index/tree/master/Yapper) to go over the really important points._** This branch will be a living, breathing, and constantly evolving representation of the roller-coaster that comes with cofounding an early-stage startup -- _come back in a few days to see all the new things that we add_!

Ed O'Bannon v NCAA found that Universities can set up a trust of $5k per player per year of eligibility. We are crowdfunding that trust. Any transfers to an individual player in excess of $5k will be distributed evenly to that player's teammates. #playfortomorrow
