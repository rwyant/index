## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT (SDK)
### Functionality 
The SDK lets anybody create a public, group conversation where ever they are. The radius of the chat is customized, and anyone within that radius can participate in the conversation. There's no need to exchange phone numbers or contact information -- as long as you're within the radius of the conversation you can participate. 

### Drunk Mode
Yapper has integrated our location-based group chat feature in [Drunk Mode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drunk-mode-party-app-friend/id628228162?mt=8) as **'Hotspots'**.

Other _Drunk Mode_ users can keep up on what is happening through a sophisticated system of geofences, push notifications, and most importantly, drunk people!
