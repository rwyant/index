# Yapper - Membership, Engagement, and Retention
## LESSONS LEARNED

## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT (SDK)
### Functionality 
The SDK lets any mobile user create a public, group conversation where ever they are. The radius of the chat is fully customizable, and anyone within that radius can participate in the conversation. 

With Yapper's SDK, there's no need to exchange phone numbers or contact information -- as long as you're within the radius of the conversation you can communcate with other people around you. 

### Drunk Mode
Yapper has integrated our location-based chat feature in [Drunk Mode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drunk-mode-party-app-friend/id628228162?mt=8) as **'Hotspots'**.

Other _Drunk Mode_ users can keep up with what's going on through a sophisticated system of geofences, push notifications, and most importantly, drunk people!
