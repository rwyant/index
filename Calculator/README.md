# Calculator
## DESCRIPTION
Welcome!

This repo hosts the solution to General Assembly's iOS Development Course Midterm. The prompt was to create a fully-functioning Calculator App from scratch that includes a) a display, b) a numbered keypad, c) an 'equals' button, d) add, multiply, subtract, and divide operators, e) a 'percent' button, f) a 'clear' button, g) a '+/-' button, and h) supports portrait orientation. 

Here is the original prompt for this Midterm:

> Working solo or in pairs, build a functional clone of the iOS calculator app from scratch. Use the tools weâ€™ve covered so far to build a template for your app, flesh out its UI and build its data models. In order to get exposure to technical speaking you will also have the option of giving a short technical presentation to the class on a number of preselected topics.
