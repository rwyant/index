# Calculator
## DESCRIPTION
Welcome!

This repo hosts the solution to General Assembly's iOS Development Course Midterm. The prompt was to create a fully-functioning Calculator App from scratch that includes 
- Display
- Numbered keypad
- Equals (=) button
- Add, multiply, subtract, and divide operators
- Percent (%) button
- Clear (c) button
- '+/-' button
- Supports portrait orientation

Here is the original prompt for this Midterm:

> Working solo or in pairs, build a functional clone of the iOS calculator app from scratch. Use the tools weâ€™ve covered so far to build a template for your app, flesh out its UI and build its data models. In order to get exposure to technical speaking you will also have the option of giving a short technical presentation to the class on a number of preselected topics.
