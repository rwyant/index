### SUMMARY
For my final project in my Mobile Development course, I worked with a friend at Surprise Industries to create a delicious Murder Mystery Game, inspired by a certain homophonic podcast.

### DESCRIPTION
Hello mystery lovers and problem solvers. Cereal is a delicious murder mystery audio game for 2 or more players, inspired by a certain homophonic podcast. Compete with friends to spot clues, catch inconsistencies, and crack the case.

When Marcus Hailey, a popular college student, is found dead on the beach in Thailand during a Study at Sea program, his classmates and professors are all stunned. How did this happen? 

Reporter Kara Seinig dives into the case, interviewing everyone who may have useful information. You, dear adventurers, will listen to 7 episodes of the story she has collected. But, it's up to you to spot the lies and piece together the truth. Who killed Marcus Hailey?

As you navigate this murder mystery audio journey, you will study evidence, perform handwriting analysis, look for fingerprints, analyze maps, and solve secret codes and riddles.

The complete experience takes about 2 hours and can be played by groups of 2 or more. Like any game, there will be a winner. Will it be you?

Happy sleuthing!
